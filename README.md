# Homework 2

Nearly every Shiny application requires you to translate user inputs to allow them to manipulate the data you visualize for them. For this assignment you must use data from an open data website (you may download and clean the data and write it as a CSV). You must also use a different UI layout than what you used in Homework 1.

Directions: Use plotly (with or without the aid of ggplot2) to create three (3) different kinds of figures and one (1) data table. Include at least three (3) types of inputs, one (1) functioning downloadButton() and one (1) observer in the server. On the server side your plots and tables must utilize the reactive function for any and all datasets.
