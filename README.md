# Homework 2

Due Date: 10/4

Everyone loves maps, they like to zoom to where they live, where theyâ€™ve been, and it often places valuable context about their neighborhood, country and world. Students will create a series of leaflet maps with data from polygons, polylines, dataframe (csv/xlsx) or point and/or raster data. Map data can be spatial data from any resource. (World Maps are fine). Please Knit and include your final output in an HTML file.

Each Map will include: 
*	A Basemap
*	One map with a layer of points
    * Students may use either circles or markers
*	One map with a layer of lines
*	One map with a layer of polygons
*	One of the maps must contain a variable which changes of the color of the elements or the marker with an accompanying legend
*	One map must contain a functioning layersControl() with two basemaps and two different layers (by name do not need to be a different type of layer)
